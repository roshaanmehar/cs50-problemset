## CS50 Problem Set Solutions

### Overview
This repository contains solutions to the CS50 Problem Set (PSet) problems 1 through 6. Each problem is implemented in C and Python, following best practices and adhering to the course's problem requirements.

### Problem Set Breakdown

#### **Problem Set 1: C Basics & Debugging**
- **Hello World**: Introduction to C syntax and printing output.
- **Credit**: Implements Luhn’s Algorithm to validate credit card numbers.
- **Mario (Pyramids)**: Prints half-pyramid and full-pyramid structures based on user input.

#### **Problem Set 2: Arrays & Encryption**
- **Caesar**: Implements the Caesar cipher to encrypt messages.
- **Substitution**: Uses a key to substitute letters in a message.
- **Readability**: Determines text readability using the Coleman-Liau index.

#### **Problem Set 3: Algorithms & Searching**
- **Plurality**: Implements a simple plurality voting system.
- **Runoff**: Implements a runoff election simulation.
- **Tideman**: Uses a ranked-choice election system with a pairwise comparison algorithm.

#### **Problem Set 4: Memory**
- **Filter**: Applies image filters using bitmap image processing.
- **Recover**: Recovers lost JPEG files from raw memory data.

#### **Problem Set 5: Data Structures**
- **Speller**: Implements a spell checker using a hash table.

#### **Problem Set 6: Python**
- **Mario (Python Edition)**: Reimplementation of Mario in Python.
- **Credit (Python Edition)**: Reimplementation of credit validation in Python.
- **DNA**: Analyzes DNA sequences to find STR (Short Tandem Repeats) matches.
